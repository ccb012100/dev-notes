# vim-plug

[[Vim]]/[[Neovim]] plugin manager

<https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug>

## Installation failure

If the editor doesn't install vim-plug after adding `plug.vim` to the `autoload` directory according to [the
instructions](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#installation), then check that the runtime path is correct (`:echo
&rtp`).

The instructions for [[Windows]] seems to differ from reality.
