## Settings Repository

### [[git]] configuration

Rider sets up its own [[git]] repository in AppData to sync settings changes.

To set the username and email, you need to change the `./git/config` file in that repo.

It's located at `~/AppData/Roaming/JetBrains/Rider2021.2/settingsRepository/repository/.git/config`.
