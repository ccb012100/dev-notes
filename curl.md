# cURL

`-k`, `--insecure`

> (SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform "insecure" SSL connections and transfers. All SSL connections are attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate bundle installed by default. This makes all connections considered "insecure" fail unless -k, --insecure is used.

`-i`, `--include`

> Include the HTTP response headers in the output. The HTTP response headers can include things like server name, cookies, date of the document, HTTP version and more...
>
> To view the request headers, consider the `-v`, `--verbose` option.

`-L`, `--location`
